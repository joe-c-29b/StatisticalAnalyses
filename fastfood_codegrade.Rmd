## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Question 1: Looking only at Burger King and Chick-Fil-A, which item has the highest calories?  The answer should be saved as Q1.
```{r}
Q1 <- fastfood %>%
  filter(restaurant == 'Burger King' | restaurant == 'Chick Fil-A') %>%
  arrange(desc(calories)) %>%
  head(1)
Q1
```
  
## Q2 What is the mean sugar amount for all items from Subway?  Save the value as Q2.
```{r}
Q2 <- fastfood %>%
  filter(restaurant == 'Subway')%>%
  summarise(mean_sugar = mean(sugar, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
Q2
```

## Q3 What is the mean value of calories for all items from Taco Bell?  Save the value as Q3.
```{r}
Q3 <- fastfood %>%
  filter(restaurant == 'Taco Bell')%>%
  summarise(mean_calories = mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
Q3

```

## Q4 Create a variable equal to total_fat x sugar called fatXsugar.  Produce a tibble that has the restaurant, item, and fatXsugar for the top 3 items, from highest to lowest.
```{r}
Q4 <- fastfood %>%
  mutate(fatXsugar = total_fat * sugar) %>%
  select(restaurant, item, fatXsugar) %>%
  arrange(desc(fatXsugar)) %>%
  head(3)
Q4
```

## Q5 How many restaurants have an average saturated fat over 10?
```{r}
Q5 <- fastfood %>%
  group_by(restaurant) %>%
  summarise(mean_sat_fat = mean(sat_fat, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(mean_sat_fat > 10) %>%
  nrow()
Q5
```
