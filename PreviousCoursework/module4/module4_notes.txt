What is Time Series Analysis
	Forecasting = predicting the future state of some key variable, to predict future values of quantitative data
	Time Series Analysis = sequence of observations on a variable that occur at equally spaced time intervals
		business questions:
			-what will demand for a business' product be next year?
			-how will revenue be affected by different seasons during the year?
		needs for time series:
			1) past data about what we want to forecast
			2) data must be quantitative or quantifiable
			3) expectation that past data patterns will extend to future


Patterns in Time Series Data
	Random fluctuations = data fluctuations that do not demonstrate a particular pattern
	Horizantal pattern = pattern viewed along the x axis
	Stationary data = average isn't changing up or down over time
	Seasonality = data points vary based on time of year/ season
	Linear patterns = downward or upward trends
	exponential trend pattern = the absolute change from one time period to the next is different, but the percent change from one time period to the next is the same
	


Naive Forecasting Methods and Forecast Accuracy
	Naive method = use the actual value from previous period to forecast next period
	Forecast error = the difference between the actual amount and the predicted amount
		e = error
		t = time period
		yt = actual value
		y^t = predicted value
		n = total number of periods
		k = past periods used to produce forecast
	Methods for evaluating a forecast method:
		-Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = average of all of the absolute values of the forecast errors
		-Mean Squared Error (MSE) = the average of the squared errors
		-Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = the square root of the MSE
		-Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) =  ;allows to compare forecasts across different time unity


Simple Moving Average
	simple moving average = take the average of several of the most recent time periods to use for each forecasted value, for the next point, just move the average forward by one time period
		a method of short term forecasting, filters out short term fluctuations and smooths out existing data, sometimes called the "smoothing approach"
	centered moving average = take values for an odd number of time periods centered around a midpoint and average all those values together
	One-sided moving average = average a few time periods before the current time period
	Accuracy = minimizing error between actual and predicted values
		looking for the lowest values for accuracy measures; the lowest are the best
	moving average is good for datasets displaying a horizantal pattern





Simple Exponential Smoothing Method
	simple exponential smoothing method = weighted sum of the past values of the time series variable; weights past data values less than more recent data values in forecasting
		a short-term forecasting method for time series data showing a horizontal pattern
	how to choose a smoothing constant?
		decide on how much weight to give the current and past values of time series variable
			large alpha = more attention to most recent observation; less smoothing
			small alpha = additional attention to past observation; more smoothing
		Default smoothing constant = 0.2



Using Regression for Forecasting
	What if the data demonstrates a systemic trend up or down?
		Can use regression analysis
	Regression is a statistical method used to create a model and equation that shows how variables are related
		can be used to make predictions
		one outcome variable
		one or more predictors
	Simple Linear Regression Model = outcome variable: time series variable you are trying to forecast; predictor variable is time
	Time variable = trend variable
	**it only gives you a reasonable prediction for data with a very strong linear trend; only if you are very certain that the linear trend will continue into the future
	



Seasonality without Trend
	Linear Regression can allow us to make prediction when our data shows seasonality
	Seasonal effects around a horizontal mean line
		add dummy variables to the model to account for seasonal (predictable time spikes)
		dummy variables act as parts of a whole
			can't add all of them
				k = levels in a categorical variable
				k-1 = the number of dummy variables in a model (because zeroes across the board counts as a category as well
				reference (comparison) variable = the dummy category you leave out
				interpret the slope coefficients in comparison to the reference variable



Quadratic Trend Model
	Polynomial regression models capture curvilinear trends
	Quadratic Models are just one type of polynomial regression models
