## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
##installations
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lm.beta")
```
```{r}
#library
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lm.beta))
```
```{r}
data("msleep")
summary(msleep)
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
##question 1
```{r}
##Run cor.test for the relationship between total sleep and body weight.  You should not round these values.

Q1 <- cor.test(msleep$sleep_total, msleep$bodywt)

Q1
```

##question 2
```{r}
##Create a correlation matrix for the relations among total sleep, rem sleep, brain weight, and body weight.  Make sure to remove missing values.
Q2 <- select(msleep, sleep_total, sleep_rem, brainwt, bodywt) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  cor() %>%
  round(digits = 2)
Q2

```

##question 3
```{r}
##Run a regression predicting body weight by vore. 
sleepModel <- lm(bodywt ~ vore, data = msleep)
Q3 <- round(sleepModel$coefficients, digits = 2)
Q3
```

##question 4
```{r}
##Create a regression predicting bodywt by vore and REM sleep.  Compared to the model in Q3, which one has the better AIC?
sleepModel2 <- lm(msleep$bodywt ~ msleep$vore + msleep$sleep_rem, data = msleep)

AICmod1 <- AIC(sleepModel, k = 1)
AICmod2 <- AIC(sleepModel2, k = 2)
print(AICmod1)
print(AICmod2)
Q4 <- AICmod2
Q4
```


##question 5
```{r}
##Create a logistic regression predicting whether or not an animal is a carnivore or herbivore based on sleep total.  Assign the model to Q5.

voreSleep <- msleep %>%
  select(vore, sleep_total) %>%
  filter(vore != "omni" & vore != "insecti") %>%
  mutate(vorebin = ifelse(vore == 'carni', 0, 1))
voreSleep
voreSleepMod <- glm(vorebin ~ sleep_total, binomial(), data = voreSleep)
Q5 <- voreSleepMod
Q5
