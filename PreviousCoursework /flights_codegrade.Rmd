## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Question 1: What is the mean distance of flights for each of the carriers AA, EV, and FL?
```{r}
Q1 <- flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  filter(carrier == 'AA' | carrier == 'EV' | carrier == 'FL') %>%
  summarise(mean_dist = mean(distance, na.rm = 'TRUE'), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2)
Q1
```
  
## Q2 For the month with the highest number of flights, what is that value? Hint: use head(1).
```{r}
Q2 <- flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(1)
  
Q2
```

## Q3 Find the five shortest minimum distances, called min_dist, by origin/destination combination.  
```{r}
Q3 <- flights %>%
  group_by(origin, dest) %>%
  summarise(min_dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(min_dist) %>%
  head(5)
Q3

```


## Q4 What five days of the year had the highest mean distance when leaving from JFK?  Sort in descending order.
```{r}
Q4 <- flights %>%
  filter(origin == 'JFK') %>%
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  summarise(mean_distance = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_distance)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2)%>%
  head(5)

Q4
```

## Q5 Calculate the maximum arrival delay for flights to Boston and Atlanta, separately.
```{r}
Q5 <- flights %>%
  filter(dest == 'BOS' | dest == 'ATL') %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(max_arr_delay = max(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(dest))

Q5
```
