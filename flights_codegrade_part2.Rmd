## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
##installations
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lm.beta")
install.packages("nycflights13")
```
```{r}
#library
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lm.beta))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(nycflights13))
```
```{r}
data("flights")
summary(flights)
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
##question 1
```{r}
##Address the outliers for departure delay as described in the outliers lectures, using 0.997 and 0.003 as the cutoffs.  What percentage of data remains following the removal of these outliers?   

upperO <- quantile(flights$dep_delay, .997, na.rm = TRUE)

lowerO <- quantile(flights$dep_delay, .003, na.rm = TRUE)

upperO
lowerO

outliers <- which(flights$dep_delay > upperO | flights$dep_delay < lowerO)

noOflights <- flights[-outliers,]

Q1 <- (nrow(flights) - length(outliers)) / nrow(flights) *100

Q1

```

##question 2
```{r}
##Run cor.test for the relationship between departure delay and distance. 

Q2 <- cor.test(noOflights$dep_delay, noOflights$distance)

Q2
```

##question 3
```{r}
##Create a regression predicting departure delay from distance.

modelflights <- lm(noOflights$dep_delay ~ noOflights$distance, dat = noOflights)

Q3 <- summary(modelflights)

Q3
```

##question 4
```{r}
##Calculate standardized regression coefficients with lm.beta for the regression from Q3.

lm.beta(modelflights)

```


##question 5
```{r}
##Create another regression, this time adding carrier to the regression from Q3. 

modelflights2 <- update(modelflights, .~. + noOflights$carrier)


Q5 <- summary(modelflights2)

Q5
```
